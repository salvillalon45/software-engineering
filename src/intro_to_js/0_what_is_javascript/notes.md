# What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is not a class-based object-oriented language! BUT it still has ways of using object-oriented programming concepts

JavaScript is a lightweight interpreted language with first class functions

## What are first - class functions

When functions are treated like any other variable.

-   A function can be passed as an argument to other functions
-   Can be returned by another function
-   Can be assigned as a value to a variable

JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

## What is prototype based?

Allows the creation of an object without first definning its class

## What is thread, single - thread?

A **thread** means running multiple tasks or programs at the same time!

### What does that mean for JavaScript?

JavaScript is single threaded! This means it cannot execute more than one program at time.
But we can do something similar to multi-threaded by using **Web Workers**.
we can use **Web Workers** to implement it! Where each worker executes independently.
