# Design a Stack

Design a Stack class

Write a push method that pushes an element to the top of the stack, a pop method that removes and returns the element on the top of the stack, a peek method that looks at the top element in the stack, an isEmpty method that checks if the stack is empty, and a clear method that removes all elements from the stack. Normally stacks don't have this, but we've added a print helper method that console logs the collection.

Your `Stack` class should support the following operations:

-   `push` Adds an element to the stack.
-   `pop` Removes and returns the top element of the stack.
-   `clear` Clears the stack.
-   `peek` Return the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
-   `isEmpty` Check if the stack is empty.
-   `getStack` To get the current stack

Will need the following private variables:

-   `index`: represents the current index for the next element to be pushed
-   `size`: variable represents the number of elements in the stack
-   `stack`: represents the data structure we will do the operations on
